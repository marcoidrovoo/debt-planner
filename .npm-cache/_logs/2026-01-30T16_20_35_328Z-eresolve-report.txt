# npm resolution error report

While resolving: paycheck-plan@1.0.0
Found: @capacitor/core@6.2.1
node_modules/@capacitor/core
  @capacitor/core@"^6.1.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @capacitor/core@"^8.0.0" from @capacitor/ios@8.0.2
node_modules/@capacitor/ios
  @capacitor/ios@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
